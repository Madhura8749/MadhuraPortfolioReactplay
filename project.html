            <h6>MY PROJECTS</h6>
        <p>
         
        During my 5th semester of engineering, I have done one miniproject based on Database management system. And the project 
        tittle is ,<span>"Server Notification Management system"</span>. While doing this project, I have learnt how to manage Time,
        and how to communicate and present project. I choose the different topic so that I can get to know how to perform coding 
        and i got to know the things better. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Server Notification Management System</span> is an application or set of application that lets 
            network engineers to manage networks independent component inside a bigger network. It is used to 
            manage server issues. Notification will pop-up when the server is not reachable.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I have used MYSQL as backend, and for frontend - Java Swings. The platform used is 
            JDBC jar.
